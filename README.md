<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In the Mobile App, there are 4 classes of users .
They are:
* Pharmaceutical companies/R&D companies
* Medical Store - Pharmacists
* Patients of the Hospital or other Hospitals
* Doctors of the Hospital
They all have their own respective Log In sections.
A greater inter-communication is made very easily
via the App without the need for advertising the
newly launched Products(Drugs/Treatment
tools/Medical equipments).

First, Pharmaceutical Companies need to register via the App. The required files/proofs
need to be submitted in order to be authenticated as companies. Once the company is
authenticated, a unique secret code is generated and sent to the Pharmaceutical company
via mail. Once the company has got the unique code, they can create any number of
accounts using that code. Hence all the staffs working in that company can register via this
code.

Now once the sign in is done, the next step is to upload all the new
products(drug/treatment tools) the company launches each time. This is
as simple as uploading a photo in a social media like Instagram, Facebook.

Doctors can daily go through the App, which provides a news feed of the latest products at
the top of the home page. Also respective products(drug/treatment tools) are available on
the respective sections based on the specialization(Eg: Cardiology, Odontology, Urology....).
So the doctors can get to know easily about the newly launched product along with all the
details of the product.

The doctor has ability to chat and contact with the respective company regarding a product.
Also the doctor has the ability to chat with other doctors, as well as group chat with their
team.

If a newly launched product was found to improve the medication, the doctors can click the
share button and use the filters appropriately and just click the 'share' button
to recommend the product to the desired patients.

Doctors can also view a Compact form of the Patient's profile that contains the details of
previous drug history, current medications, along with other vital parameters like Age, Sex,
BP, Sugar Level and so on.

After that single click by the doctor, the respective patients receive a notification
via the App. The patient can simply enter the App and find the list of
products(drug/treatment tool) suggested by the Hospital's doctors. If the patients
wants to try that medicine, he/she can simply click the search icon on the home
page and select a medical store at their convenience.

Hence, the Medical Pharmacy(initially need to sign up via the App), can respond
for that and can pre order them as per the patient's request. Also, the Medical
Store can inform the patient when the drug has arrived to their store, so that the
patient can go and buy them.

Also, the patients can easily chat with Doctors, in order to ask whether/not to use
the drug to ensure the safety of the patients.
